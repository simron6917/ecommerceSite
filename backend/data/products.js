Make sure your plants have a good amount of organic matter, as well. They greatly benefit from regular applications of fertilizer or a single application of a slow-release fertilizer.Marigolds also perform best in full sun, which will keep tall plants sturdy and help form large, dense, blooms and foliage. In part shade or more, all parts of the plant are more susceptible to fungal diseases, such as powdery mildew. Avoid wetting the foliage, especially later in the day, to help prevent problems with this. Marigolds are also susceptible to spider mites in the dry heat of the summer, so watch for fine webbing and treat with insecticidal soap as needed."

As soon as the threat of frost has passed, begin to harden off plants. Plant them outside once the seedlings have developed two sets of leaves and a robust root system. Water regularly as browallia doesn't tolerate drought. Pinch back plants to keep them bushy."

    "description": "This old-fashioned cottage-garden staple goes by many names: garden balsam, rose balsam, and even “touch-me-not,” thanks to explosive seed discharges from ripe pods. With “impatiens” as part of the botanical name, you may expect to see something similar to its cousin, the flat-flower garden impatiens (Impatiens walleriana). In fact, balsam bears colorful flowers that range from cup-shape single blossoms to double blossoms that resemble camellia. Whichever version you gravitate toward, this annual will add a tropical flair to the garden throughout the growing season.",

Get a head start for the growing season by sowing seeds on top of moist soil indoors 4 to 6 weeks before the last spring frost. The seeds germinate quickly, often in as few as 4 days. Seeds also can be sown directly in the garden. Pinch off plant tips when they are 4 to 6 inches tall to encourage branching. Set out your seedlings or purchased plants in pots after the last frost date. No further care (other than supplemental watering when needed) is necessary. This plant may self-seed, sometimes aggressively in tropical climates."

This is especially true of older varieties, which are especially sensitive to heat. If plants do begin to go out of bloom, they can become a little rangy in habit. This is the perfect time to give the plants a good shearing to shape them up, as well as encourage a fresh wave of new growth and blooms. Give them a dose of fertilizer when you cut them back to rejuvenate them."

    "care_must_knows": "These fanciful foliage plants are easy to grow and make excellent houseplants or container plants. The flowering types generally bloom outdoors during the short days of the year in winter hardy plant zones and begin flowering in the fall and continue until spring. They also bloom in cool summer climates. A great bedding plant, plectranthus can be used with flowering plants to add color with their foliage when other plants may not be in bloom.\n\nFor best results, make sure to plant plectranthus in good, well-drained soil. One of the surest ways to kill a plectranthus is overly wet soil or pots that hold too much water. These plants are similar to a succulent and can handle short droughts from time to time. Even when the whole plant wilts, it will generally bounce back quickly when watered again.\nThe species you are growing dictates the amount of sun needed and whether the plant will thrive indoors or outside. While almost all plectranthus can grow in full sun, most will prefer a bit of shade, especially in the afternoon sun. Light foliage varieties, especially gold ones, can sometimes burn in full sun causing unsightly bleached leaves. Some varieties can handle quite a bit of shade, but some of the bright color varieties will tend to \"green out\" with the foliage taking on a green tinge in too much shade. Indoors, most plectranthus will do best in lots of sunlight; a southern exposure ideally yields the brightest color. Many will handle eastern or western exposures, and only the most shade tolerant will thrive in northern windows.\n\nMany varieties of plectranthus are quick growing. To keep them looking nice and tidy, give them an occasional pruning or pinching. For young plants, it is best to pinch off a few leaves just up from the base. This encourages good branching early on and helps create a bushy plant. It is also good to pinch off old flower blooms. This coaxes some of the longer-blooming types to rebloom, and gives all of them a tidier look."

Fertilization with a time-release plant food encourages growth and more flowering spikes. Salvias flower on spiky racemes or panicles rising above the plant. When blooms are spent, remove these spikes to encourage additional flowering. If the salvia plant begins to look tired or overgrown by midsummer, you can also remove one-third of the plant.

Grow it as an annual plant in all other Zones. When choosing a planting location for tweedia, search for a place that is protected from strong wind. The delicate flowers are easily damaged in heavy gusts and intense rain. A sunny, sheltered corner of a patio or the south or west side of an evergreen shrub often provides excellent shelter for delicate plants.\n\nTweedia grows well in containers, raised beds, and in the ground. Start seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last predicted frost in your area. Provide this short, vining plant support at planting time by placing it at the base of a trellis or teepee. Since it grows only 1  to 3 feet tall, it can benefit from small branches sunk into the ground alongside the plant as extra support. Tweedia can be overwintered indoors. Bring containers indoors in fall before frost and place them in a bright, cool spot."

This shows up on the plants as a powdery white residue on the leaves, and eventually causes the plant to slowly decline in vigor. Generally it will not kill a plant, but will stress it some and slow it down. This is a common problem with the purpletop vervain, especially on lower growth. The best solution for powdery mildew is to plant the plants in a well circulated area, making sure the plants leaves dry out well after a rain or watering. If this has been a problem in the garden in the past, make sure to clean up any old plant debris like dead leaves or stems on the ground. Cleaning up old material is the best prevention and rotating plantings so the same susceptible plants aren't in the same spot each year."

For in-ground plantings, add compost or slow-release fertilizer to keep gorgeous displays going throughout the growing season. For wishbone flower in a container, add fertilizer in either a slow-release formation or by liquid feed on a regular basis. Wishbone flower prefers to be consistently moist, so don't let it dry out between waterings. Don't let the soil get and stay soggy, though, or root rot can become a problem.\n\nOften grown as a shade plant, wishbone flower is tolerant of brighter sun exposures. As long as it is kept evenly moist and watered regularly, it can handle full sun conditions. The ideal growing conditions for this annual are found in part shade with protection from the hot afternoon sun. With full shade, the plant tends to bloom less and appear less dense than its sunnier counterparts. Some older varieties are less tolerant of hot weather. In southern climates you should look for varieties that are better able to withstand the summer heat."

It also helps keep plants dry, which prevents common diseases such as powdery mildew—a condition most commonly seen as a white powder found on the plant's bottom leaves. While this pesky fungus probably won't kill the plants, it does diminish their beauty. The best control method for powdery mildew is prevention; look for resistant zinnia varieties and keep plenty of airflow around the plants.\nLeaf spot and blight are two more common diseases found in zinnias. Similar to powdery mildew, these conditions are caused by fungi. Control methods are the same: Remove any debris from the base of the plants to keep them clean. Many of these fungal diseases are found on the lower leaves of taller zinnia varieties used for cut flowers. Place shorter plants in front of taller zinnias to hide their naked stems.\n\nSaving zinnia seeds is a good way to start next year's plants. Because many zinnias are sold as mixes, you don't have to worry about seedlings being identical to the parent plant. As old flower heads dry, remove spent blooms and harvest the small arrowhead-shape seeds from between each of the petals. Zinnia seeds can be started directly in the ground the following spring."

    "care_must_knows": "Water the newly planted tuber to saturate the soil to a depth of 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm.) to give your Gloriosa climbing lily a good start. Keep the soil evenly moist until shoots appear in two to three weeks. Reduce water to once or twice a week or whenever the soil feels dry an inch (2.5 cm.) below the surface. Gloriosa climbing lilies typically require an inch (2.5 cm.) of rain a week and need supplemental watering during dry periods. Train the vines to climb the trellis by tying them to the trellis with soft plant ties, if necessary. Although climbing lilies cling to the trellis once established, they may need some help from you to get them started. Fertilize climbing lilies every two weeks with water-soluble fertilizer designed for flowering plants. This provides the nutrients needed to promote healthy blooming. Cut the vines back in the fall after they are killed by the frost. Tubers can be lifted and stored in moist peat moss in a cool, dark place for the winter and replanted in the spring."

Water bulbs well after planting and cover the planting spot with a 2-inch layer of mulch, if desired.\n\nAfter blooms fade, the plant's strappy green foliage adds color and texture to the garden for several weeks. The foliage can be removed in early summer after it begins to turn yellow. One of the easiest bulbs to grow, grape hyacinths return for decades, needing to be divided only every 3 to 5 years.

Many gardeners take advantage of this and plant them among other plants to act as a barrier to troublesome critters. Try planting some at the front of garden borders, or surrounding tender lily bulbs. The fact that most alliums are also bulbs also works to their advantage.

A slow-release fertilizer keeps cannas relatively happy when they're planted in containers, but regular doses of liquid fertilizer help them look their best.\n\nAs a group, cannas tolerate a variety of sun conditions. Older varieties and species tolerate shade, but full sun brings out the best leaf color and flower show. Cannas growing in warm southern climates need a bit of afternoon shade to keep foliage from bleaching. Taller varieties need full sun to prevent flopping, which necessitates staking.\nIn areas where cannas are not winter hardy, they can be stored for the following year. If they are being grown in containers, keep them in the same pot and withhold water as temperatures drop in late fall. Once the foliage begins to die back, move the pots to a cool, dark place, such as an unheated garage or basement.

Daffodil flowers typically follow the sun, so make sure any shade is at the back of the site to get forward-facing flowers. When considering where to plant daffodils, don't overlook the ground beneath the canopy of deciduous trees. Much of daffodils' growth is completed before deciduous trees leaf out in spring, making that ground prime for underplanting. Bulbs there may require additional watering though, because the tree roots can rob the soil of moisture.\n\nPlant daffodils in fall after the soil cools slightly, but before it freezes. As a rule of thumb, each bulb should be planted two to three times as deep as the bulb's diameter (most are planted 4 to 6 inches deep).  Spacing also depends upon bulb size. In general, plant the bulbs 4 to 10 inches apart. Small bulbs can be closer together; large bulbs go farther apart. Don't fret if spacing makes the planting bed look bereft of bulbs; they'll fill in the gaps as they naturalize over the years.\nMake quick work of planting drifts of bulbs by digging a large trench and scattering several bulbs in the planting hole—making sure the pointy ends face up. Cover with soil, then water well to get rid of air pockets. Step back and await an avalanche of color in the spring."

    "care_must_knows": "Dahlias grow equally well in the ground or containers. If you purchase them as bare-root tubers, start them indoors early in the spring for a head start on the growing season. To do this: Plant the tubers in a pot of well-drained potting soil about six weeks before the last frost; place the pots in a sunny window and keep warm. Keep the soil evenly moist, but not wet to avoid rot. Once the foliage emerges and the danger of frost has passed, plant in the ground.\n\nWhen choosing where to use dahlias in the landscape, consider the mature height of the plant. Some large varieties, including the dinner plate dahlia, require staking or tall neighbors to support the heavy flowers. Dwarf and small varieties don't require additional support.\nUsing a low nitrogen fertilizer helps to increase their prolific blossoms. Full sun encourages more upright plants that need less staking, but these plants will still flower in part shade. If planted in shadier areas, the foliage tends to look greener than burgundy on dark-leaved cultivars."

If your ground has a high clay content, amend liberally with organic matter at planting time to help give your blackberry the best possible start.\nPrune blackberry in two waves to keep it productive. The first wave, which happens in spring, is called tip pruning because you simply cut off the top couple of inches of new growth. This encourages your blackberry plants to produce more side branches—which means more fruit. The second wave of pruning happens in late summer. Remove any stems that produced fruit; those stems won't produce fruit the following year.

Water a loquat tree when the blossoms begin to swell in spring and two to three more times when the fruit begins to ripen. Apply the water slowly, allowing it to sink into the soil as much as possible. Stop when the water begins to run off. Young trees don’t compete well with weeds, so maintain a weed-free area that extends 2 to 3 feet (60 to 91 cm.) from the trunk of the tree.

It simply means to cut off the top couple inches of new growth. This encourages your raspberries to produce more side branches—which means more fruit. The second wave of pruning happens in fall.

Strawberries spread by runners that will emerge from the crown and create daughter plants nearby. Strawberry plants are often planted 18 to 30 inches apart in rows that are 3 to 4 feet apart. Runners extend from the plants to form daughter plants, increasing the width of the row. For best plant health and harvest, maintain rows that are no more than 2 feet wide. This planting method is called the matted row system. Strawberries grow best in full sun. A partly shaded planting area will greatly reduce berry production. Well-drained soil is essential. Wet or boggy soil will limit plant growth and increase the potential for berries to rot after ripening. If your landscape is plagued by poorly drained soil, plant strawberries in a raised bed."

Both plants mix well with herbs in a traditional herb garden or try growing them alongside perennials in a mixed border.",

For earlier flowers, start seed indoors in small pots about 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost."

It is evergreen to 10°F but will quickly reappear in the spring if it freezes. If you want to see the unique, 2-inch-wide, dark purple flowers, get on your hands and knees and look at the base of the plants. Though not particularly showy, they are interestingly attractive. \nPlants spread quickly by underground rhizomes, forming a thick mat of foliage that crowds out weeds.

It eventually forms a thick mat of foliage that tends to flop over unless cut back.",

Leaves dish up a sweet anise flavor used to create traditional Bearnaise sauce and the fines herbes blend vital to French cooking. In rich soil, plants practically jump out of the ground, thriving with little care. For best growth, remove flowering stems. With a sunny window and rich soil, you can raise French tarragon indoors. If light isn't strong enough, stems will likely sprawl and leaf flavor will diminish, but you'll still be able to savor the licorice taste. In the garden, pair French tarragon with bearded iris, burgundy-toned shrubs, or lilies for an eye-pleasing scene. In coldest zones, cut plants back in fall and mulch after the ground freezes.",

Asparagus ferns prefer warm and humid climates (about 70 degrees F) and cannot withstand temperatures below 55 degrees F for very long periods of time. Asparagus ferns do not require periods of winter dormancy but will appreciate a resting period and reduced watering during the winter months.\n\nTo promote dense plant growth, pinch back the stem tips. If plant shape becomes too sprawling, the stems can be cut back close to the soil to regenerate and encourage new growth. During their active growing period, apply a weak liquid fertilizer about once a week.\nYou'll know when asparagus fern needs to be divided or repotted. Watch for fleshy bulbs to push the plants out of the pot. At this point, you can repot in a slightly larger container or divide the plant. When dividing, be sure to take several of the underground bulbs. Mature asparagus fern plants can become quite woody with sharp spines on the branches. This is something to keep in mind when trimming older plants."

When planting in a container, use a general-purpose potting mix with plenty of peat moss to help retain moisture. This plant likes consistently moist, well-drained soil that is allowed to dry out to an inch or so below the surface between waterings. Soggy soil can be fatal, so make sure your potted plant doesn't sit in water.\n\nHigh humidity, on the other hand, is a plus. If your plant's foliage develops brown edges, it's not getting enough humidity. You may need to move the potted plant to a more humid spot like the bathroom.

To develop a watering schedule when you first get English ivy, water it well, then check the soil every few days to see when it needs watering again. Do this a few times and you'll develop a rhythm for your plant.\tWatch out for drafty spots—if English ivy is exposed to hot or cold drafts, the leaves will brown and crisp prematurely. Keep it away from heating and air-conditioning vents, as well as ill-fitting old doors or windows."

Although it can tolerate an occasional missed watering, allowing them to dry out regularly stresses the plant.\nWhen it comes to lighting, ficus plants can be somewhat finicky. Ficus require high levels of light, especially for the best coloring of its leaves. But there are varieties of ficus that tolerate medium to low-light conditions. In low-light conditions, ficus tend to be sparser and can have poorer branching habits. They also tend to be much slower growing in less light. If moved suddenly to a new spot with different light levels than it's used to, ficus can drop a large amount of leaves. Though alarming, the plant recovers once it adapts to new conditions.\n\nIn the right conditions, ficus grow relatively fast. If you've got a large kind, this can become troublesome because it can quickly outgrow its space. Regular pruning prevents this and promotes good branching. However, there is a limit to the amount of pruning larger species of ficus tolerate. For woody types, starting a new plant by air layering is the best option."

This eastern United States native comes from a shady woodland environment. Similar in many ways to the traditional bleeding heart, fringed bleeding heart comes up in spring and blooms right away. The flowers aren't quite as obviously heart-shaped, but they are no less beautiful. One benefit to the fringed bleeding heart is that it is not an ephemeral, so it stays up in your garden all through the growing season. This also means that you may get a few reblooms in the early summer if it stays cool, and potentially again in the fall as the summer dies down. The foliage on the fringed bleeding heart is smaller and finer than the old-fashioned type."

It doesn't require a well-drained location as many other plants do, making it a wonderful option for wet, boggy areas of your garden. Jack-in-the-pulpits are poisonous, especially the corms (bulblike roots), so exercise caution when planting these if you have pets and/or small children around. To plant, dig a 6-inch-deep hole and place the corm as you would a crocus or other small bulbs, root side down. These are ephemeral plants: Once they have bloomed and stored enough energy for next year, the foliage dies back. Plan to fill bare spots with annuals.\nTo prevent slugs from damaging Jack-in-the-pulpit, place a small bowl or container filled with a few inches of beer near the plants. The slugs can't resist the smell, crawl into the container, and drown. Another way to deter slugs is to keep landscape tidy: Slugs like to spend their days under leaves and other plant debris, where it's nice and moist. Sprinkling diatomaceous earth, eggshells, grit, sand, gravel, and pine needles creates barriers slugs don't want to crawl over to reach your Jack-in-the-pulpit plants, too."

Solid green leaf varieties can handle full sun as long as they don't dry out. Varieties with variegated foliage appreciate part shade to prevent burning their tender foliage. In deep, full shade, some variegated varieties may green up and be less vibrant. The key is to balance the appropriate amount of sun to keep the foliage looking good, while also finding the right amount to encourage the most blossoms. The bloom period of Jacob's ladder is fairly short, so err on the side of keeping the foliage looking its best by focusing on overall plant health.\nLittle additional maintenance is needed to keep these plants looking nice. Deadhead spent blooms to prevent plants from wasting energy on seed production. Some varieties of Jacob's ladder will naturalize by reseeding themselves around, so if you want to prevent the plant from spreading, keep up with deadheading."

There are even some species that will do just fine in full shade.\nMost spiderworts prefer to be planted in well-drained soil that stays somewhat moist. Some species can handle drought much better than others and can even do fine in consistently drier soils. In very dry soils, especially in the summer, plants may go dormant, which can commonly happen in southern climates with hot summers. Foliage is generally the first thing to decline, becoming yellowed and limp. When this happens, plants can be cut back to the ground. Come fall and cooler temperatures, many species of spiderwort will happily begin again, sending up new shoots and sometimes new blooms."

Some types are like succulents and can be treated like a cactus. These types are drought-tolerant; err on the side of more dry than wet because they can rot, leaving you with a pile of mush.\n\nSpurge has a milky white sap when cut or damaged. This sap is generally poisonous and is what makes the plant deer- and rabbit-resistant. The sap is an irritant to humans as well, so wear gloves when you are handling spurge as it can cause a skin rash. Also, avoid getting the sap in your eyes; it can cause vision problems, even blindness."

When grown in a cool, shady environment, brunnera can tolerate occasional droughts as long as it receives supplemental waterings during the extended ones. (Silver-leaf varieties handle heat and humidity better than specimens with leaves of other colors.) Promptly remove unsightly foliage and spent flower heads to maintain a plant's good looks. Cut back badly damaged plants to encourage regrowth and improve their health overall. In ideal soil conditions, heartleaf brunnera will spread very slowly via underground rhizomes to create large clumps of plants—in a similar fashion to hosta.\n\nBrunnera's tolerance to sun exposure varies depending on leaf type and color. Some varieties—such as the above-mentioned 'Dawson's White'—benefit from some morning sun that promotes colorful foliage and a greater number of flowers. Some silver and gold varieties lose a little luster in full shade, taking on more of a green appearance. In cooler climates some varieties (especially green ones) can thrive in full sun as long as they are well watered. Brunnera may struggle in regions with hot, humid summers.

Water at least weekly, increasing frequency in times of extreme heat. Although similar in looks to both black-eyed Susan and coneflowers, this plant does not share their ability to withstand droughts. It also dislikes boggy areas, so make sure the planting bed doesn't retain standing water.\n\nHelenium grows quickly and will require frequent deadheading in order to produce new flowers and reduce its fondness for self-sowing. Some of the taller varieties may require support or staking to keep plants upright. Pinch deer-resistant helenium back in spring to make it shorter and bushier, possibly at the cost of delaying flowering. Once it blooms, cut the flower stalks down to the foliage. Divide helenium every three years in the spring after it comes out of dormancy to ensure vigor."

The mother rosette (or hen) multiplies freely by runners that spread in all directions to form offsets (or chicks). Eventually the hen blooms, sets seed, and dies—leaving behind all its chicks to form colonies and carry on the botanical process. Hens and chicks grows very small, fine roots, which allows it to penetrate tiny cracks and thrive in rock gardens. This plant looks great in trough gardens and containers since its small, young plantlets will eventually trail over the sides. Hens and chicks also adds color and texture to regular gardens, to living succulent wreaths, and between pavers on patios and walkways.",

With anything less, you increase the probability of numerous problems, such as fewer blooms, more stems flopping over, and overall weak, sparse plants. Foliar diseases are the biggest problem for many roses, and grandifloras are very susceptible to all the most common ones that plague roses. One of the worst is black spot, a fungal disease that causes dark spots on the foliage. In many climates, black spot is almost inevitable for rosebushes. The best thing to do is to be proactive and plant in full sun, prune properly for good air flow, and avoid getting the foliage wet when possible. Mildews are also troublesome, including powdery and downy varieties. Control these as you would black spot."

Their biggest downfall is drought conditions, especially during and leading up to winter. If fall has been dry, give these plants (especially young ones) supplemental water. This also helps prevent one of the biggest problems with arborvitaes: winter burn.\nPlanting arborvitaes in dry soil and exposed to winds during the winter will likely cause winter burn. The first sign of winter burn is browning of the leaves. In severe situations, this can cause significant damage to arborvitae and may even kill them. Luckily, there are newer, burn-resistant varieties you can plant. You can also site your arborvitae out of direct sunlight and wind. Wrapping young and sensitive plants in burlap can help as well.\n\nA few pests may bother your arborvitae. Spider mites can appear, especially during the hot and dry days of summer. Unfortunately, by the time you find these pests, it'll be too late, as you'll most likely notice browning foliage due to their feeding that can't be reversed. Use an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, but be careful if it is during the heat of the summer because these sprays can also cause the plants to burn."

Forsythias prefer well-drained, evenly moist soil, but they are pretty tolerant of many different soil types. They can also handle drought fairly well once established and can even get along just fine in clay soils. For the best blooms, make sure to plant your forsythias in full sun. These versatile shrubs can handle part shade, but you will generally have fewer blooms come spring. The chance of fall color is also diminished in more shade. The best way to keep forsythias maintained and to conserve their original habit is by selectively pruning out old wood after blooming. Remove any branches that look old and woody at the base of the plant. This will encourage the plant to branch at the base, preventing any erratic new growth from cut stems. If plants are truly out of control or just messy, forsythias can be refreshed with a harsh rejuvenation pruning. This can be done by cutting back the entire shrub to just above ground level. Harsh pruning will encourage the whole plant to re-flush, and can also bring back their old habit if the shrubs had been pruned poorly in the past."

If you do fertilize, use a plant food that is low in nitrogen and phosphorus (the first two numbers on a fertilizer package) and higher in potassium (the third number on a fertilizer package).\nLeucadendron likes humidity and good air circulation, so plant it in the open and avoid crowding plants together. To avoid foliar diseases, water plants at the base. If overhead watering is the only option, irrigate earlier in the day so foliage can dry before nightfall. Leucadendron is drought-tolerant once the roots have established themselves, but does benefit from a regular, deep watering. Allow the soil to dry somewhat between waterings. Mulch once a year to control weeds and conserve moisture. Deadhead this shrub to keep it tidy. Prune after flowering is done for the season."

In cool climates where the oleander is not hardy, overwinter potted plants indoors.\n\nUnlike some plants that have one toxic compound, the oleander has several, which can cause issues with the digestive tract and cardiovascular and nervous systems. Most of these compounds are only harmful when eaten, so no part of the oleander should be ingested by humans or animals. Also be careful when pruning an oleander because the milky sap can cause skin irritation.\n"

Most germander species tolerate dry conditions, making them ideal for xeriscape gardens. One exception: American germander (Teucrium canadense), which is native to North America, grows well in poorly drained soil such as that of rain gardens.\nGermander is hardy and evergreen in most regions. It is marginally hardy in some areas of Zones 5 and 6, where winter damage is common. If your germander experiences winter damage, simply prune away dead branches the following spring, and plants will produce new foliage. Protect plants susceptible to damaging cold by insulating them with a thick blanket of straw in winter.\n\nRegarding pruning in general: The best time to prune this plant is right after flowering, because spent germander flowers give it an unkempt appearance. Pruning restores germander's structural presence in the garden. Pruning after flowering also encourages the plant to channel energy into creating new foliage. If needed, remove a few inches of green, leafy growth (along with the flower stalks) to reduce plant size. Avoid pruning plants in fall as the new growth will be susceptible to winter damage."

Golden-leaf cultivars such as Tiger Eyes (a staghorn sumac) need some shelter from the afternoon sun to prevent leaf burn. If this plant grows in full sun, its brightly colored foliage may show evidence of bleaching.\nSumac spreads easily, typically forming a dense thicket of growth via underground rhizomes. Keep this characteristic in mind when deciding where to plant it, because larger species may be difficult to control. Smaller species are easier to control by digging. Some sumacs spread via seeds, so deadhead spent blossoms if self-seeding is a concern."

In a container, use any general purpose potting media, and make sure to plant them in a large pot. Eucalyptus are fast growers, and their roots can quickly fill a small container.\n\nAs far as exposure, eucalyptus needs full sun, which helps plants grow sturdy and promotes better branching, brighter silver foliage, and higher oil content. If you are trying eucalyptus as a houseplant, or overwintering one, give it as much sun as possible in the home. Usually a bright southern exposure will work best.\nIf you are planting eucalyptus in an area where they are hardy, the plant can become invasive. Studies show that eucalyptus trees may exhibit allelopathic affects on some species of plants, which is when a plant releases a toxin into the soil so that competing plants cannot grow. There is still some uncertainty as to the level of allelopathy that eucalyptus trees have, but it's still something to consider when planting.\nEucalyptus trees are also notorious for being messy. As many species age, they shed portions of their bark, littering the ground below. On the plus side, this exfoliating bark can be quite beautiful, especially during the winter. Some species, like E. deglupta, are grown almost primarily for their bark. This species is also known as the rainbow eucalyptus, and as the bark exfoliates, depending on the age, the plants color differently. So whole trunks can be varying shades of yellows, greens, reds, and purples.\n\nMany species of eucalyptus have different-shaped leaves, depending on the maturity of the plant. Leaves may begin as round and coin-shape, then as the plants age, become long, lance-shape leaves. Don't be alarmed if you plant seeds and they aren't quite what you expect. The trees may just need to grow into their proper shape."

This needled evergreen does not grow well in areas with hot and humid summers—especially where the temperature consistently exceeds 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Protect this tree from hot afternoon sun and strong drying winds by siting it in a shaded, sheltered location.\n\nPlant trees in spring or early summer and water them regularly during the first two years after planting to help them develop a strong root system. Cover the root zone with a 2-inch-thick layer of shredded bark mulch to prevent soil-moisture evaporation. Hemlock trees are sensitive to drought. Water them deeply during drought conditions and monitor year-round for drought stress (evidenced by needles that turn yellow and die). This condition makes hemlock trees susceptible to a host of other insect and disease problems."

The trees acclimate to many soil conditions: wet and boggy, well-drained, or even a little dry. It grows especially well near ponds and streams where the soil is often too moist for other tree species. Weeping willow grows fast—as much as 24 inches a year—so take its mature size into consideration.  Plant a weeping willow transplant or bare-root plant in spring and water it regularly during the first growing season to encourage a strong root system. Deer tend to like to eat its tender new growth, so fence young trees.  A variety of pests plague the tree. Blights, powdery mildew, leaf spots, and cankers are all common. Insect pests include aphids, scale, borers, lacebugs, and caterpillars. It is susceptible to cracking because of its weak wood, and branches are commonly damaged in wind, snow, and ice. Litter from leaves, twigs, and branches can be a nuisance in landscapes. Also, weeping willow's shallow roots make it tough to garden underneath."

Sow seeds in soilless planting media and water them gently until they emerge. Place the seedlings in a bright, sunny window or use grow lights to provide consistent bright light. Transplant seedlings outdoors when all chance of frost has passed. Plant seedlings 10 to 12 inches apart and water them during periods of drought. Weed around amaranth regularly to prevent competition for water and nutrients from nearby plants. Amaranth does not require fertilization during the growing season.\nHarvest leaves 30 to 50 days after seeding. Remove individual leaves as needed, or cut the entire plant back to 8 inches from the ground to encourage tender new growth to develop. Harvest seeds for grain 100 to 110 days after seeding. Bend mature seed heads over a large bowl or bucket and shake them to catch the many tiny black seeds."

    "care_must_knows": "Green beans are easy to grow from seed planted directly in the garden. One of the keys to a great bean crop is to wait until the night temperature regularly stays above 55° F before planting. Bean seeds germinate poorly if planted too early. Select a full sun planting site that has fertile, well-drained soil. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 4 inches apart in rows 18–24 inches apart. Sow seeds every three weeks or so until the end of June to provide a long, continued harvest.\nCommonly munched by rabbits and deer, protect bean plants with fencing if these garden invaders are a problem in your area. Few other pests and diseases threaten beans. Prevent disease in future years by planting beans in a different spot in the garden each year. This practice is called crop rotation and cuts down on disease proliferation."

Transplant fall crops of spinach outdoors in the ground in mid to late August.\n\nWater spinach regularly to keep the soil moist (but not wet and soggy) because the plant doesn't tolerate drought. If your yard has clay soil, grow spinach in containers or raised beds to give it the conditions it needs to produce lush, delicious leaves. If your soil is poor and low in nutrients, spinach will do much better if you add compost into the planting hole with your seeds, then fertilize after the seeds have sprouted and have grown several sets of leaves.\nYou may be able to extend the spinach growing season by a couple of weeks by spreading a 2- to 3-inch-deep layer of mulch around the plants. This keeps the soil cool as days get hot. (Spinach declines once temperatures rise above 80 degrees F or so.) Plus, a layer of mulch helps the soil stay moist in dry weather and prevents weeds from growing, making care a breeze."

Not only will seedlings struggle to get established in clay and slow-draining soil, but fruit that develops will have a higher chance of rotting when it sits on moist soil. Plant melons in raised beds if drainage is a problem.\n\nStart melons from seed planted directly in the garden after the last chance of frost passes. Melon seed germinates when the soil temperature is above 65ºF. Seeds planted in cold soil are more likely to suffer from disease and rot. Sow seeds in group of two or three anywhere between 18 to 24 inches apart. Space rows 5 to 6 feet apart. After the seedlings emerge, choose the strongest plant and remove the others. Melons produce long vining stems. Be sure to give them plenty of space to spread in the garden.\nMelons can also be started from transplants purchased at the garden center or from transplants started indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last spring frost. Melon transplants are sensitive to root disturbance. Transplant young plants carefully to prevent breaking or damaging the roots. Water melons carefully. Plants demand 1 to 2 inches of water per week during the peak growing season. Water plants with a drip or soaker hose, saturating the soil but keeping the foliage dry. Gradually reduce watering as the fruit ripens. Too much watering during the last two weeks of ripening can cause the fruits to split."

If your ground has a high sand or clay content, amend it liberally with organic matter such as compost, peat, or coir to fuel your pumpkin plants' rampant growth. This is especially important if you're growing giant varieties.\n\nBecause pumpkins are heat-loving plants, place seeds or transplants outdoors after soil temperatures remain above 60 degrees F. If you put them out too early and it's still cold, your seeds or young plants will sulk in cool weather and potentially rot before they grow. If you're in a short-summer area, start your pumpkin seeds indoors three to four weeks before you'd normally plant them outdoors to get a head start on the season.\nIf you grow pumpkins in rows, space your plantings 3-6 feet apart. Protect pumpkins from pests like squash vine borers by using floating row covers in spring until the plants grow too large for them.\nLeave pumpkins on the vine until the skin turns the appropriate color for the variety and the rind feels hard when pressed with your thumbnail. Harvest before a hard frost by cutting the stem from the vine with a sharp knife, leaving a 2-inch stub on the fruit. Place the harvested pumpkins at 80° to 85°F for two weeks to cure them.

These three bracts hide the true flowers inside, which are small, trumpet-shaped flowers in whites and yellows. The showy bracts are typically found on new growth, with the biggest display following their winter dormancy. Typically, you will see the best display of blooms following a dry winter. If you are using bougainvillea as an indoor houseplant, make sure to keep the plants mostly dry during winter months."

An important thing to note: In full-sun conditions, clematis prefer cool roots, so plant clematis at the base of another plant to provide some shade to the root areas. Clematis prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture. Certain species are more drought-resistant and can handle dry soils better than others.\n\nBloom time of clematis varies, depending on the species. Many new varieties are rebloomers, but most of the older types will only bloom during one season of the year. However, even after blooming, clematis flowers still add interest to the plant. As the seed heads mature, they expand to become fluffy balls that look pretty dried in floral arrangements. Some varieties can become invasive in a garden setting, so deadhead blooms to prevent overpopulation of clematis."

A container prevents the plant from growing through the pond liner or from growing too large and taking over your pond.\nAny type of container will work. Plant your lily tubers so that a bit sticks out from the heavy clay-loam soil amended with a slow-release fertilizer formulated for pond plants. To prevent soil from washing away or clouding the water, cover it with fine pea gravel. If your plant has leaves already developing, begin by placing the container so that the leaves are 6-8 inches deep. After several days, the leaves should reach the surface, then lower the plant to 12-16 inches to its final depth. During the growing season, fertilize the plants every month or two for the best blossoms. Water lilies may need fairly regular grooming of leaves as they begin to yellow and die.\nIf you are growing hardy varieties, you can leave them in the pond as long as the water does not freeze. Just lower the plants to the bottom of the pond. Come spring, as soon as any threats of late freezes are over, bring the lily pots back up to growing height. As a part of regular water lily maintenance, divide the plants every two to four years to ensure the most vigorous plants. This should be done just before plants break dormancy, usually when you are bringing them back up to growing height."
